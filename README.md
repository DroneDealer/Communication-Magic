# Communication Magic

This is a responsive chat interface designed to allow communcation between individuals regardless of language barriers through emojis. There are 3 components to the interface: a chat history, symbol synthesis, and a gesture tracker.

## Chat History
- Features a single scrollable container that displays two types of messages: written messages aligned to the left, and emoji messages aligned to the right.
- The written messages play corresponding audio in the event that the individual you are communicating with can understand but not read a language.

## Symbol Synthesis
- Individuals can mix and match basic emojis to form new, more complex emojis that represent nouns and concepts
- By combining simple emoji building blocks, players construct richer, expressive elements to complete sentences or tell stories.
- The gameplay encourages exploration, experimentation, and understanding of how simple symbols can blend together to communicate nuanced ideas â€” all within a fun and intuitive emoji-based interface.
