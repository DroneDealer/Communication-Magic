# Communication Magic

This is a responsive chat interface designed to allow communcation between individuals regardless of language barriers through emojis. There are 3 components to the interface: a chat history, symbol synthesis, and a gesture tracker.

## Chat History
- Features a single scrollable container that displays two types of messages: written messages aligned to the left, and emoji messages aligned to the right.
- The written messages play corresponding audio in the event that the individual you are communicating with can understand but not read a language.

## Symbol Synthesis
- Individuals can mix and match basic emojis to form new, more complex emojis that represent nouns and concepts
- By combining simple emoji building blocks, players construct richer, expressive elements to complete sentences or tell stories.
- The gameplay encourages exploration, experimentation, and understanding of how simple symbols can blend together to communicate nuanced ideas — all within a fun and intuitive emoji-based interface.

## Gesture Tracking
Once you’ve gotten your custom emojis from the first website, visit [link](https://dashing-croquembouche-8a581c.netlify.app) to use them! Here, you can upload your images and view them on the webcam, with the villagers being able to drag them wherever they want. This allows them to both use emojis and their gestures in order to communicate better. 
Usage:
- Press upload file to upload the image and make it appear. Please move the first file after uploading before uploading another.
- Clench your fist to “grab” an image. Place the tip of your middle finger on your palm. Your hand must be in an upright position. The image will then follow your hand, so long as you move slowly.
- The image will get bigger or smaller as you move closer or further from the screen. This can be toggled off/on with the other button
